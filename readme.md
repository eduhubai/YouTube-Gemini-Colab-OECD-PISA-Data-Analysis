## Episode Descriptions

**Part 1: Data Loading and Preprocessing**
In the first episode of our AI-driven data analysis series, we introduce the datasets and demonstrate how to load and preprocess them using Google Gemini and Colab. We cover the initial steps of data analysis, including loading the datasets, renaming columns for consistency, and handling missing values. This episode sets the foundation for the comprehensive data analysis to follow.

**Part 2: Data Visualization and Analysis**
In the second episode, we dive deeper into data analysis by creating various visualizations to uncover insights and trends. We explore different ways to visualize the data, such as histograms, bar plots, scatter plots, pair plots, and heatmaps. Additionally, we analyze trends, gender disparities, and relationships between economic indicators and test scores. This episode showcases the power of AI in transforming raw data into meaningful visualizations without writing any code.
